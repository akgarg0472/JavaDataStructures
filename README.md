# Data_Structure
Data Structure is defined as the technique that tells us how the data is stored and managed in the memory space. Managemenet of data means that how data is retrieved and manipulated in the memory efficiently.
Different Data Structures have different implementation techniques and are used according to use case.

# Generic_Data_Structures
Generic Data Structures means that for different type of data, we don't have to implement for different type of data like Integers, Strings etc. One code implementation is robust & flexible enough to manage different type of data types (excluding primitive type).  
This repository contains some of data structures which are commonly used in day-to-day life such as Arrays, Linked List, Queues, Sorting Algorithms, Trees etc.
